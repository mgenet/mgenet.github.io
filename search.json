The ultimate aspiration of my current research is to use the fundamental laws of physics and the power of modern computing and imaging facilities to improve cardiology and pulmonology. Generally speaking, my work belongs to the general field of biomedical engineering science, whose objectives are (i) to better understand the phenomenon of life in health and disease, and (ii) to develop and analyze novel concepts and methods for biomedical engineering, i.e., which will be the foundation of objective and quantitative tools for medicine, i.e., for the diagnosis and treatment of patients. More precisely, my research focuses on the development of (i) models of the mechanics of living tissues and organs (mostly the heart and the lungs), (ii) methods and tools for the simulation of such models (which can be used as a prediction tool, i.e., prognosis, but also to investigate competing hypothesis), and (iii) methods and tools for the estimation of model parameters based on clinical data (which can be used to estimate quantities that cannot be measured in vivo, i.e., augmented diagnosis, and to build personalized models, a.k.a. digital twins, that can be used to design patient-specific therapies, i.e., optimized treatment).\n\n\nEducation\n\n2022: Accreditation to supervise research (HdR), École Polytechnique, France.

    "text": "Context & Objectives The COVID-19 infection manifests itself in its severe forms as acute alveolar-interstitial and vascular disease of varying severity, the long-term course of which is unknown. A development towards fibrosing pneumopathy could affect 10 to 30% of survivors of severe forms, which would make it a public health problem due to the secondary handicap. A better understanding of the regional physiological mechanisms in the evolution of COVID-19 pneumonia in their severe forms would allow to anticipate the development or not of sequelae, in particular fibrosing.\nIn the past few years, the MΞDISIM team at École Polytechnique and Inria, in close collaboration with clinicians (pulmonologists and radiologists) from Avicenne AP-HP Hospital/Sorbonne Paris Nord University/INSERM, as well as image processing experts from Telecom SudParis, has developed a poromechanical model of the human lung, together with an estimation pipeline allowing to personalize the model to a patient based on clinical images [1]. Until now the focus of the group was on idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis; however, the consortium has just received a grant from the ANR to adapt the image-based patient-specific modeling pipeline to COVID-19 patients.\nMore precisely, the project concerns the processing of CT images of patients followed at the Avicenne AP-HP hospital for an assessment of vascular remodeling and regional lung mechanics/compliance. These parameters obtained at 2-3 months of the COVID-19 infection will be correlated with clinical, CT, and functional data at 6 months and 1 year of follow-up. To do so, developments are required at the modeling level (to adapt the model to the new disease), on the numerical method level (to automatize the few remaining manual steps) as well as at the implementation level (to streamline the image à model pipeline).\nKeywords Pulmonary Biomechanics; Image-based Modeling; Finite Element Method; Data assimilation\nCandidate profile We are looking for a postdoc. The funding is for one year, but could be further extended if we receive other grants. The candidate will have a fair understanding of continuum mechanics, with if possible knowledge of finite strains, biomechanics, and numerical methods. He/She will be at ease with computational pipelines, and also have an interest in the application in pulmonology, especially for interacting with clinical collaborators.\nWork environment The work will take place within the MΞDISIM team (joint between École Polytechnique & Inria) and within the Solid Mechanics Laboratory, on the École Polytechnique campus. It will be co-supervised by Martin Genet & Dominique Chapelle, and in direct contact with clinicians and image processing scientists. It should start as soon as possible.\nBibliograpy\n[1]  C.

    "text": "Title: Equilibrated warping: Finite element image registration with finite strain equilibrium gap regularization\nAuthors: Martin Genet, Christian T. Stoeck, Constantin von Deuster, Lik Chuan Lee, Sebastian Kozerke\nAbstract: In this paper, we propose a novel continuum finite strain formulation of the equilibrium gap regularization for image registration. The equilibrium gap regularization essentially penalizes any deviation from the solution of a hyperelastic body in equilibrium with arbitrary loads prescribed at the boundary. It thus represents a regularization with strong mechanical basis, especially suited for cardiac image analysis. We describe the consistent linearization and discretization of the regularized image registration problem, in the framework of the finite elements method. The method is implemented using FEniCS & VTK, and distributed as a freely available python library. We show that the equilibrated warping method is effective and robust: regularization strength and image noise have minimal impact on motion tracking, especially when compared to strain-based regularization methods such as hyperelastic warping. We also show that equilibrated warping is able to extract main deformation features on both tagged and untagged cardiac magnetic resonance images."

    "text": "Proposition de sujet de thèse: Modélisation poro-mécanique multi-échelle du poumon, de la respiration au remodelage chronique associé à la fibrose pulmonaire\nContexte La fibrose pulmonaire idiopathique (FPI) est une maladie chronique du poumon au pronostic très sévère [1]. À l’échelle alvéolaire, au cours du développement de la maladie les alvéoles pulmonaires fusionnent par destruction de l’interstitium (la paroi inter-alvéolaire) [1]. Et physiologiquement, la maladie se traduit par un volume pulmonaire accru, mais une altération forte de la fonction respiratoire avec perte d’efficacité des échanges gazeux [1]. Même si positivement corrélée à des facteurs tels l’hérédité ou le tabagisme, la cause directe de la maladie est largement inconnue (d’où le qualificatif « idiopathique ») [1]. De même, la voie de progression est loin d’être quantitativement comprise ; cependant, le rôle régulateur de la mécanique semble prépondérant : il a récemment été postulé que dans le poumons sain les fibres de collagènes sont lâchement enchevêtrées et représentent un fusible mécanique pour les fibroblastes (les cellules qui synthétisent le collagène) ; au contraire dans le poumon fibreux la matrice de collagène est plus dense et tendue et les fibroblastes sont alors davantage sollicités, entraînant une spirale pathologique [2].\nObjectifs L’objectif général de la thèse est de développer une modélisation fine du poumon au cours de la respiration et du remodelage chronique associé à la fibrose pulmonaire, ainsi qu’une méthode d’assimilation de données dédiée au modèle et aux données cliniques (typiquement, des images). Le modèle servira de cadre pour formuler quantitativement les hypothèses existantes (et éventuellement de nouvelles hypothèses) sur le développement de la maladie. Augmenté des données, il représentera un outil de diagnostic objectif et quantitatif pour la fibrose pulmonaire. Sur le plus long terme, il pourrait servir de base à un outil d’optimisation de traitement personnalisé. Le travail se situera dans la continuité des travaux de l’équipe MΞDISIM, notamment sur la poro-mécanique [3] et sur l’assimilation de données [4]; il ouvrira également un nouvel axe de recherche sur la modélisation microscopique du comportement passif des tissus mous, complémentaire du travail sur le comportement actif [5]. Plus précisément, le travail s’organisera autour des trois axes suivants:\n(A1) Adaptation du modèle poro-mécanique macroscopique existant [3] au cas du poumon, et mise en place d’une stratégie d’assimilation de données dédiée au modèle et aux données cliniques (images, mesures de pression).\n(A2) Développement d’un modèle poro-mécanique « microscopique » (échelle des alvéoles pulmonaires), ainsi que d’un pont micro-macro d’homogénéisation avec le modèle « macroscopique » (échelle du poumon) proposé en (A1).\n(A3) Introduction dans le modèle microscopique des mécanismes de remodelage chronique associés à la fibrose pulmonaire, et étude de l’influence sur le comportement à l’échelle de l’organe (la respiration).\nProfil du candidat Le/La candidat/e devra maîtriser la mécanique des milieux continus, avec si possible des connaissances en grandes transformations, en biomécanique, et en méthodes numériques. Il/Elle aura également un intérêt pour l’application en pneumologie, notamment pour l’interaction avec les collaborateurs cliniques.\nCadre de travail La thèse se déroulera dans le cadre de l’équipe MΞDISIM (commune au Laboratoire de Mécanique des Solides de l’École Polytechnique & Inria), sur le campus de l’École Polytechnique.\nBibliographie  [1] B.

    "text": "Context Living tissues are made of highly complex hierarchical materials, with a large number of biochemical/biophysical mechanisms interacting at various spatial and temporal scales. This complexity can be addressed through modern modeling and simulation methods (e.g., multi-physics coupling, homogenization, model reduction, etc.), in close interaction with experimental assays. This leads to a better understanding of living tissues, the ultimate goal being to develop objective and quantitative diagnostic and prognostic tools for the clinic—biomedical engineering. The team has already proposed detailed models of cardiac poromechanics [1], electromechanics [2,3] and hypertrophy [4,5], whose coupling raises important fundamental and technical questions.\nObjectives The PhD will aim at developing a modeling and simulation framework including multiple strongly coupled spatial and temporal scales. In terms of spatial scales, the mechanisms driving the tissue’s chronic evolution at small scales (cellular growth, extracellular remodeling, etc.) will be introduced in the electromechanical model developed in the team, and homogenized (relying in particular on the method of the multiplicative decomposition of the transformation gradient) to generate the macroscopic behavior. In terms of temporal scales, a method will be developed to accelerate the resolution of periodic solutions of the cardiac cycle, and indirectly simulate a very large number of cycles. The work will focus on specific remodeling conditions, including cardiac hypertrophy induced by myocardial infarction and cardiac amyloidosis, around which the team develops experimental protocols in collaboration with the clinical world.\nCandidate Profile The candidate must master continuum mechanics, with preferably (but not necessarily) a good knowledge of large transformations and biomechanics. He/She will also have a marked interest in the cardiac application, especially for the interaction with the clinical collaborators.\nWork environment The work will take place within the MΞDISIM team (a joint team of Inria & École Polytechnique), which is located on the École Polytechnique campus.\nContacts / Applications For more information, you may contact .genet@polytechnique.edu and dominique.chapelle@inria.fr.

    "text": "Context & Objectives The lungs are the primary organs of the respiratory system in humans and many animals, responsible for molecular exchanges between external air and internal blood through mechanical ventilation. It has an extraordinary complex architecture, with the inherent fractal structure of the bronchial and blood vessel trees, as well as the hierarchical structure of the parenchyma. Lung biomechanics has been extensively studied by physiologists, experimentally as well as theoretically, from the air flow, blood flow and tissue stress points of view, laying the ground for our current fundamental understanding of the relationship between function and mechanical behavior. However, many questions remain, notably in the intricate coupling between the multiple constituents, between the many phenomena taking place at different spatial and temporal scales in health and disease. For example, even for healthy lungs, there is no quantitative model allowing to link tissue-level and organ-level experimental material responses.\nThese fundamental questions represent real clinical challenges, as pulmonary diseases are an important health burden. Interstitial lung diseases, for instance, affect several million people globally. Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF), notably, a progressive form of interstitial lung diseases where some alveolar septa get thicker and stiffer while others get completely damaged, remains poorly understood, poorly diagnosed, and poorly treated, with a current median survival rate inferior to 5 years. It has, however, been hypothesized that a mechanical vicious cycle is in place within the parenchyma of IPF patients, where fibrosis and damage induce large stresses, which in turn favor fibrosis.\nThe general goal of this project is twofold: (i) scientifically, to better understand pulmonary (solid) mechanics, from the alveolar scale to the organ in health and (IPF) disease; (ii) clinically, to improve diagnosis and prognosis of (IPF) patients through personalized computational modeling. More precisely, the student will develop a many-scale model of the parenchymal biomechanics, at all relevant spatial scales from the alveolus to the organ, and at the temporal scales of the breathing cycle and fibrosis process. Different representations at successive spatial scales will be linked by a computational nonlinear homogenization strategy with a priori model reduction based on a neural network. The model will integrate the rather unique experimental data produced by Drs. Bel-Brunon and Trunfio-Sfarghiu from LaMCoS (INSA-Lyon), i.e., microtomography images at alveolar scale and inflation tests of lobules: microstructures will be extracted from the images and systematically analyzed, and model parameters will be estimated from the mechanical tests. The model will also integrate clinical-radiological data provided by Profs. Nunes and Brillet from Avicenne APHP Hospital, i.e., standard pulmonary function tests and thoracic computed tomography imaging on IPF patients as well as normal lung controls: a pipeline to estimate observable model parameters from clinical data will be set up, and generic values will be defined for the remaining parameters. The model and estimation procedure will represent augmented diagnosis and prognosis tools for the clinicians.\nKeywords Pulmonary Biomechanics; Image-based Modeling; Finite Element Method; Computational Homogenization; Neural Networks; Data assimilation\nCandidate profile The candidate will have to master continuum mechanics, with if possible knowledge of finite strains, biomechanics, and numerical methods. He/She will also have an interest in the application in pneumology, especially for interacting with clinical collaborators.\nWork environment The thesis will take place within the MΞDISIM team (joint between École Polytechnique & Inria and within the Solid Mechanics Laboratory), on the École Polytechnique campus. It will be in tight collaboration with the LaMCoS at INSA-Lyon. It will be co-directed by Martin Genet, Aline Bel-Brunon & Dominique Chapelle. It should start in 2020. It could be preceded by an M2 internship.\nBibliography\n[1]  B. Hinz and B. Suki, “Does Breathing Amplify Fibrosis?,” Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med., 2016.\n[2]  D. Chapelle and P.

R. Mécanique], cf. dedicated post) to perform direct (i.e., without evaluating the model itself) estimation of model (material and/or loading) parameters from full field measurements. The method is a priori highly sensitive to noise, but we showed that using the equilibrium gap as regularizer for motion tracking allows to extract displacement fields from dynamic images that are robust enough to be used for direct parameter estimation. All the details are in the paper: [Peyraut & Genet, 2025, C. R.

    "text": "Context & Objectives The lungs are the primary organs of the respiratory system in humans and many animals, responsible for molecular exchanges between external air and internal blood through mechanical ventilation. It has an extraordinary complex architecture, with the inherent fractal structure of the bronchial and blood vessel trees, as well as the hierarchical structure of the parenchyma. Lung biomechanics has been extensively studied by physiologists, experimentally as well as theoretically, from the air flow, blood flow and tissue stress points of view, laying the ground for our current fundamental understanding of the relationship between function and mechanical behavior. However, many questions remain, notably in the intricate coupling between the multiple constituents, between the many phenomena taking place at different spatial and temporal scales in health and disease. For example, even for healthy lungs, there is no quantitative model allowing to link tissue-level and organ-level experimental material responses.\nThese fundamental questions represent real clinical challenges, as pulmonary diseases are an important health burden. Interstitial lung diseases, for instance, affect several million people globally. Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF), notably, a progressive form of interstitial lung diseases where some alveolar septa get thicker and stiffer while others get completely damaged, remains poorly understood, poorly diagnosed, and poorly treated, with a current median survival rate inferior to 5 years. It has, however, been hypothesized that a mechanical vicious cycle is in place within the parenchyma of IPF patients, where fibrosis and damage induce large stresses, which in turn favor fibrosis.\nThe general goal of this project is twofold: (i) scientifically, to better understand pulmonary (solid) mechanics, from the alveolar scale to the organ in health and (IPF) disease; (ii) clinically, to improve diagnosis and prognosis of (IPF) patients through personalized computational modeling. More precisely, the student will develop a many-scale model of the parenchymal biomechanics, at all relevant spatial scales from the alveolus to the organ, and at the temporal scales of the breathing cycle and fibrosis process. Different representations at successive spatial scales will be linked by a computational nonlinear homogenization strategy with a priori model reduction based on a neural network. The model will integrate the rather unique experimental data produced by Drs. Bel-Brunon and Trunfio-Sfarghiu from LaMCoS (INSA-Lyon), i.e., microtomography images at alveolar scale and inflation tests of lobules: microstructures will be extracted from the images and systematically analyzed, and model parameters will be estimated from the mechanical tests. The model will also integrate clinical-radiological data provided by Profs. Nunes and Brillet from Avicenne APHP Hospital, i.e., standard pulmonary function tests and thoracic computed tomography imaging on IPF patients as well as normal lung controls: a pipeline to estimate observable model parameters from clinical data will be set up, and generic values will be defined for the remaining parameters. The model and estimation procedure will represent augmented diagnosis and prognosis tools for the clinicians.\nKeywords Pulmonary Biomechanics; Image-based Modeling; Finite Element Method; Computational Homogenization; Neural Networks; Data assimilation\nCandidate profile The candidate will have to master continuum mechanics, with if possible knowledge of finite strains, biomechanics, and numerical methods. He/She will also have an interest in the application in pulmonology, especially for interacting with clinical collaborators.\nWork environment The thesis will take place within the MΞDISIM team (joint between École Polytechnique & Inria and within the Solid Mechanics Laboratory), on the École Polytechnique campus. It will be in tight collaboration with the LaMCoS at INSA-Lyon. It will be co-directed by Martin Genet & Philippe Moireau. It should start in 2021. It could be preceded by an M2 internship.\nBibliography\n[1]  B. Hinz and B. Suki, “Does Breathing Amplify Fibrosis?,” Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med., 2016.\n[2]  D. Chapelle and P.

However, many questions remain, notably in the intricate coupling between the multiple constituents, between the many phenomena taking place at different spatial and temporal scales in health and disease, and these fundamental questions represent real clinical challenges, as pulmonary diseases are an important health burden.\nThe MΞDISIM team, joint between the Solid Mechanics Laboratory of École Polytechnique and INRIA has recently developed a lung model [1] based on a general formulation of poromechanics [2]. The model can be personalized for a given patient by assimilating clinical data, with the aim of providing computational tools to clinicians for better diagnosing and in fine treating patients suffering from various pulmonary diseases [3]. This work has been funded notably by an ANR Young Investigator grant (PI: Martin Genet) and an ANR COVID grant (PI: Pierre-Yves Brillet, APHP & Université Sorbonne Paris Nord/INSERM).\nThe project associated with the present PhD offer, funded by a European Innovation Council Pathfinder Open grant (PI: Xavier Maître, Université Paris-Saclay/CNRS), aims at developing low-field 3D magnetic resonance spirometry for advanced regional exploration of respiratory diseases. This would allow more widespread, totally innocuous and fully dynamics lung in vivo imaging, compared to the current state of the art based on expensive, ionizing and mostly static computed tomography scanners. This will however represent significant change to our modeling approach (from quasi-static to dynamic) and associated data assimilation pipeline (from computed tomography to magnetic resonance images), which will be the main objective of this PhD.\nKeywords Poromechanics; Pulmonary Biomechanics; Image-based Modeling; Finite Element Method; Data assimilation\nCandidate profile The candidate will have to master continuum mechanics (with, if possible, knowledge of finite strains & biomechanics) and numerical methods (notably the finite element method & integration schemes). He/She will also have an interest in the application in pulmonology, especially for interacting with clinical collaborators.\nWork environment The thesis will take place within the MΞDISIM team (joint between École Polytechnique & INRIA and within the Solid Mechanics Laboratory), on the École Polytechnique campus. It will be in tight collaboration with other members of the EIC project, notably Télécom SudParis (Catalin Fetita) & Paris-Saclay University (Xavier Maître). It will be directed by Martin Genet, in direct collaboration with Dominique Chapelle. It could start in 2023, and could be preceded by an M2 internship.\nBibliography\n[1]  C. Patte, M.
