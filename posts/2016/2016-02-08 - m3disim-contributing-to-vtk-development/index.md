The [Visualization Toolkit (VTK)](http://www.vtk.org) is the open-source library underlying [ParaView](http://www.paraview.org)â€”it is a very efficient piece of software for everything related to geometry, images and meshes.
After being a user for many years, I recently corrected some bugs related to the handling of second order tensors, and my patches are now part of the library's master branch, for everyone to use.
