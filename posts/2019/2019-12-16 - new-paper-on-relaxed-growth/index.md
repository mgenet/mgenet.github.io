I just published [a paper in Clinical Biomechanics](https://authors.elsevier.com/a/1aDtiyxzYfKIv), introducing a new framework for controlling growth-induced residual stresses in the context of the kinematic growth approach (i.e., multiplicative split of deformation gradient), through an additional relaxation step.
