I will be giving a plenary talk on mechanics-based biomedical image processing during the upcoming workshop "[Biomechanics from cells to tissues](http://lptms.u-psud.fr/biomech2019)", which "aims to bring together engineers, physicists and life scientists working at the interface between mechanics, biology and medicine to exchange recent results and stimulate further interactions within the Paris-Saclay and broader Paris area.".
