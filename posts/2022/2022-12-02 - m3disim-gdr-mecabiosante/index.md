This week we are taking part to the [MécaBioSanté GdR](https://gdr-mecabio-sante.cnrs.fr) annual workshop: [Mahdi Manoochehrtayebi](https://m3disim.saclay.inria.fr/people/mahdi-manoochehrtayebi) presented his PhD work on multiscale modeling of the lung parenchyma, and I chaired a session on biomechanics of soft tissues. Looking forward to next year's meeting!
