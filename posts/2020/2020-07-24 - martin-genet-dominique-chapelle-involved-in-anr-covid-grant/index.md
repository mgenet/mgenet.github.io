Together with [Dominique Chapelle](https://m3disim.saclay.inria.fr/people/dominique-chapelle) we are part of a project (SILICOVILUNG) selected by ANR in the 4th wave of the COVID call, cf. [https://anr.fr/fr/actualites-de-lanr/details/news/appel-anr-ra-covid-19-les-resultats-des-premieres-vagues-devaluation](https://anr.fr/fr/actualites-de-lanr/details/news/appel-anr-ra-covid-19-les-resultats-des-premieres-vagues-devaluation).

The project is managed by Pierre-Yves Brillet from Hypoxia & Lung Laboratory/Sorbonne-Paris-Nord University and Avicenne AP-HP Hospital.
It aims at better understanding the regional physiological mechanisms in the evolution of Covid-19 pneumonia in their severe forms and to anticipate the development or not of sequelae, in particular fibrosis.
It focuses on the processing of CT images of Covid-19 patients for an assessment of vascular remodeling and regional lung mechanics/compliance.

With this project we will hire one engineer or post-doc to extend [CÃ©cile Patte](https://m3disim.saclay.inria.fr/people/cecile-patte)'s PhD work, and begin its translation to the clinic.
