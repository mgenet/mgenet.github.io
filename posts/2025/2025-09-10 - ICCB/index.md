This week we attended the [11th International Conference on Computational Bioengineering (ICCB 2025)](https://iccb2025.org) in Rome:

- [Kateřina Škardová](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kate%C5%99ina-%C5%A1kardov%C3%A1-a1a7b4142) gave the keynote of the "Multiscale biophysical systems. New trends on theoretical and computational modelling" minisymposium, entitled "Finite element neural network interpolation: Interpretable and adaptive discretization for solving PDEs";

- [Alexandre Daby-Seesaram](https://alexandredabyseesaram.github.io) presented his work on "Digital twin of human lungs: towards real-time simulation and registration of soft organs";

- I co-chaired (together with [Daniel Hurtado (Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile & MIT)](http://www.ing.puc.cl/~dhurtado)) a mini-symposium on "Modeling the respiratory system: current trends and clinical opportunities", and gave a presentation on "Multiscale Modelling and Estimation of Lung Poromechanics".
