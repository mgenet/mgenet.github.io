I was invited by Gerhard Holzapfel & David Nordsletten (Editors-in-Chief) to be part of the Editorial Board of the Biomechanics and Modeling in Mechanobiology (BMMB) journal, cf. [https://link.springer.com/journal/10237/editorial-board](https://link.springer.com/journal/10237/editorial-board).
I think this is a very good journal, and I am very happy to be a part of it!
