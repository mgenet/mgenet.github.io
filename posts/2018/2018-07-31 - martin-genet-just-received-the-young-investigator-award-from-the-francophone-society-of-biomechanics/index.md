During the [8th World Congress of Biomechanics](http://wcb2018.com) in Dublin, I received the Young Investigator Award from the [Francophone Society of Biomechanics](http://www.biomecanique.org) for my talk on ["A continuum relaxed growth framework for controlling growth-induced residual stresses in living tissues"](https://app.oxfordabstracts.com/stages/123/programme-builder/submission/20740?backHref=/events/123/sessions/63&view=published).
