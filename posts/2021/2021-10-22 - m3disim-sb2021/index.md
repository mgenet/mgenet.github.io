Next week I will be presenting some collaborative work with [Nicole Tueni](https://m3disim.saclay.inria.fr/people/nicole-tueni) and [Jean-Marc Allain](https://m3disim.saclay.inria.fr/people/dominique-chapelle) on the origin of the anisotropy of the myocardium at the 46th congress of the francophone society of biomechanics ([SB 2021](https://www.cmbbe-symposium.com/2021))! I will also chair a session on "Cellular & Tissular Biomechanics".
