Together with [Kateřina Škardová](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kate%C5%99ina-%C5%A1kardov%C3%A1-a1a7b4142) and [Alexandre Daby-Seesaram](https://alexandredabyseesaram.github.io) we just submitted for publication two papers on "Finite Element Neural Network Interpolation": Part I is on "Interpretable and Adaptive Discretization for Solving PDEs" and Part II on "Hybridisation with the Proper Generalised Decomposition for non-linear surrogate modelling".
Both preprints are on ArXiv: [Part I](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2412.05719) and [Part II](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2412.05714).

We implemented our framework in a library called [NeuROM](https://github.com/AlexandreDabySeesaram/NeuROM), which is freely available, and as usual now we also publish jupyter notebooks to allow reproduction of the figures of the papers: [Part I](https://alexandredabyseesaram.github.io/FENNI-I-paper-demo) and [Part II](https://alexandredabyseesaram.github.io/FENNI-II-PGD-paper-demo).

Definitely let us know if you are interested and want to collaborate on these topics!
