This week I attended the [2024 PM-iDICs conference](https://pm-idics-2024.sciencesconf.org), and presented recent work on the use of the equilibrium gap principle for regularizing the motion tracking problem [[Genet, 2023, Comptes Rendus Mécanique](https://doi.org/10.5802/crmeca.228)], and for the direct estimation of model parameters from full field measurement (joint work with Alice Peyraut, to appear), in the "Mathematics & Algorithms" mini-symposium.

The conference was jointly held by the [PhotoMechanics Association](https://photomeca.cnrs.fr) and the [International Digital Image Correlation Society](https://www.idics.org), and perfectly hosted by the Université Clermont Auvergne.

Looking forward to PM-iDICs 2026 at École Normale Supérieure de Paris-Saclay!
