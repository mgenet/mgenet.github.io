[Kateřina Škardová](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kate%C5%99ina-%C5%A1kardov%C3%A1-a1a7b4142), who recently defended her PhD at the Department of Mathematics of Czech Technical University in Prague, is starting as a postdoc in the team.
She already visited us during her PhD, notably to work on motion tracking and published [a conference paper](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-32040-9_9) on the subject.
Her postdoc is funded by a [E4H Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://www.ip-paris.fr/en/research/research-departments-laboratories-centers-and-projects/disciplinary-and-interdisciplinary-centers/e4h-interdisciplinary-center-engineering-health/postdoctoral-fellowship-program), which she obtained with her project on Multiscale Modeling and Simulation of Remodeling in Pulmonary Fibrosis.
Welcome back and good luck, Katka!
