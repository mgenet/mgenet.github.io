[Kateřina Škardová](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kate%C5%99ina-%C5%A1kardov%C3%A1-a1a7b4142) and I are attending [MORTech 2023](https://mortech2023.sciencesconf.org) (6th International Workshop on Model Reduction Techniques) at Laboratoire de Mécanique de Paris-Saclay (LMPS), École Normale Supérieur de Paris-Saclay (ENSPS), to learn about current trends in model reduction methods—we even met a future member of the team (more on that soon)!
