I will be a keynote speaker at [the BIOREME (Biophysical Modelling in Respiratory Medicine) Network Conference 2024](https://www.bioreme.net/events-all/anwc2024), which will be held in Nottingham, UK, next Januaryâ€”it is still time to register so do not hesitate to do so if you are interested in pulmonary biomechanical modeling!
